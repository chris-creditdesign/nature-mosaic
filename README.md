#Wireframe designs for @NatureNews

### Build process

Uses [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) for file concatenation, to compile [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) and apply [JSHint](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-jshint). If you've not used Grunt before, be sure to check out the [getting started guide](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started).

Install dependencies with `npm install`

Type `grunt` to launch [browsersync](http://www.browsersync.io/docs/grunt/) and automatically watch for changes.
